# Cyclic-redundancy-Checker
This is the Verilog implementation of a cyclic redundancy checker (CRC), using FPGA technology on the Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA board. A 16-bit CRC-CCITT parallel implementation is used here, which is essential for error-free transmission of data. The CRC-16-CCITT (Cyclic Redundancy Check) is widely used in telecommunications and other systems for detecting accidental changes to raw data. It generates a 16-bit checksum for each data block using the polynomial x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1. This specific CRC standard is known for its robustness and is used in protocols such as X.25, Bluetooth, and GSM.
